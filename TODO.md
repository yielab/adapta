# 🗺 Roadmap — Adapta

> **This file is the ROADMAP: the single source of open work.** If a task isn't here, it isn't planned.
> Shipped work does not stay here: a closed block moves to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in the commit that
> closes it. Reference docs describe what *is* and never carry tasks:
> [PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md](docs/reference/PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md) (what we build) ·
> [SDD_WORKFLOW.md](docs/reference/SDD_WORKFLOW.md) (how we work: three contracts) ·
> [OPERATIONS.md](docs/reference/OPERATIONS.md) (run it) · [README.md](README.md) · [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)
> (agent working agreement) · the MkDocs site under `docs/`.
>
> **Legend:** `[ ]` open · board status `open` / `in progress` / `ready-for-live` / `done`.
> **Priority:** **P0** blocks a trustworthy `main` · **P1** needed before first customer · **P2** nice-to-have.

## How to pick up a task

Every open task is written so a developer or AI agent can execute it without prior context. Each carries:

- **Context** — why it exists / what's wrong today.
- **Scope** — the boundary (what is and isn't included).
- **Steps** — the concrete sequence of changes.
- **Files** — where the work lands.
- **Contract impact** — which SDD pillar(s) fire ([SDD_WORKFLOW.md](docs/reference/SDD_WORKFLOW.md)); change the contract **first**.
- **Gate** — the one `make` target (or opt-in integration suite) that proves it; escalate only if that gate cannot see the change.
- **Acceptance** — the observable, testable condition that closes it.
- **Close** — the doc surfaces to update, then the closure note.

**Read budget (agents):** locate the block with `grep -n '^### <id>' TODO.md`, read only that block
(`sed -n`), then only the files its **Files** line names. Do not read a whole section or this file end to
end to pick up one task. **Close** by writing **Done.** (≤ 8 lines: what changed · gate run + result · anything
skipped) and **Handoff.** under the block, then **moving the whole block to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**
(top dated section) and flipping its board row to `done YYYY-MM-DD` — then stop; out-of-scope findings become
a `Follow-up.` line (which stays here, under the board), never extra diff.

Honour the [Definition of done](#definition-of-done-per-task) on every task. Work inside the dev container
(`docker compose up -d` → `docker compose exec app make <target>`); never `pip install` by hand.

**Running the roadmap with several agents (lead + Sonnet/Haiku workers — added 2026-10-08).** Every open
block also carries **Depends.** (what must be `done` first; what it unblocks) and **Agent.** (model tier,
gate class, blocks that touch the same files, what its hand-off must name). The **§E board** is the
scheduling view; [`.claude/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`](.claude/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md) is the
procedure. Rules that keep parallel work from colliding:

- **Line anchors in Files are hints.** They drift once an upstream block lands. Locate by the symbol the
  block names (`def retrieve`, `Citation:`), treat the number as approximate, and still do not widen the read.
- **A worker edits only** the files its Files line names, its own block, and its own board row. The Status
  snapshot and other blocks' Files lines belong to the lead, who applies them from the worker's **Handoff.**
- **Gate classes decide where work runs.** `offline` gates run from a git worktree against the built
  `adapta-app` image (command in gates.md). `live` and `rebuild` gates run on the main checkout, one at
  a time, with no other edit landing there meanwhile — hot reload kills live tests and `make up` restarts
  every container. Worktrees are not bind-mounted, so editing there is always safe.
- **Closing writes two notes, then moves the block.** **Done.** (≤ 8 lines) and **Handoff.** (what downstream
  blocks must now use: names, signatures, the migration revision taken, moved anchors, measured numbers). The
  block then goes to `CHANGELOG.md`; only its board row stays here. The lead reads Handoff there.
- **Tier is a floor, not a ceiling.** `haiku` rows are mechanical and fully specified; `sonnet` rows need
  design judgement; `sonnet + human decision` rows stop after the measurement so the user can decide.

## Status snapshot (updated 2026-10-10, §E complete)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Product build (phases 0–5), operator console, image fine-tunes, brand, positioning | ✅ complete — history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) |
| Fine-tuning direction | **Decided 2026-10-09: bring your own adapter (§E4).** Training removed 2026-10-10 (E4.1); no service needs a GPU. Shipped end to end 2026-10-10: import (E4.2), CPU gate (E4.3/E4.4), promote/rollback (E4.5), console flow (E4.6), eval-set synthesis (E4.8). Pitch + import guide: E4.7. |
| SDD gates | Pillar 2 ✅ `make migrate-test` · Pillar 3: the GPU perplexity gate is replaced by the CPU task-metric gate on imported adapters (E4.3/E4.4) · Pillar 1 ✅ `make test-contracts` green (E1.11; re-run 2026-10-10 after E4.8: 40 operations, 2320 cases, 0 failures, authenticated) |
| CI fast gate (`make ci`) | ✅ green 2026-10-10 after E1.15: ruff + mypy clean, 350 unit tests |
| **Audit 2026-09-03 (§E)** | ✅ **all 39 blocks closed 2026-10-10** (E1.15 added after a live Chroma hang + socket leak). Bring-your-own-adapter end to end (import → CPU gate → promote/rollback, console, Ollama export); hybrid + multilingual retrieval (golden 0.978) with a per-project RAG gate, deterministic abstention, filters, citations with page/OCR; Docling + OCR ingestion on a queued worker, opt-in visual extraction; optional Ollama backend; JSON mode. Opt-ins measured honestly: contextual retrieval and history condensation showed no gain on the golden corpus. Open follow-ups live in each block's CHANGELOG entry. Next: no §E block is open; the highest-value follow-ups are the `"null"` field-string bug (E5.4), measuring the 7B vision default, multi-turn golden questions (E5.3), running `migrate-test` against a scratch DB (E2.3), and a long-document corpus for contextual retrieval (E5.1). |

## E. Audit 2026-09-03 — correctness, real hybrid RAG, scanned documents, governed adapters (opened 2026-09-03)

> **Source.** Product audit of 2026-09-03: code read with `file:line` evidence, GitHub API and a
> verified ecosystem scan. Headline: the product thesis (RAG + a gated adapter composed on one
> self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint, Apache-2.0, orgs/keys in the box) is still unclaimed by any
> open-source project — but the shipped product is below what the README claims in five places:
> (1) "hybrid" retrieval only re-ranks the vector candidates (`adapta/services/rag.py:239`);
> (2) text SFT trains/evaluates on a prompt format the endpoint never serves (`trainer.py:117-125`
> vs `chat_templates.py:53-61`) and its loss is not response-only (`trainer.py:236-240`);
> (3) the gate measures perplexity only — every task metric is `None` (`evaluator.py:314-326`);
> (4) three of five catalog models are *Qwen Research License* (non-commercial), the default included;
> (5) ingestion has no OCR — scanned PDFs are rejected (`documents.py:134-135`) and images not accepted
> (`files.py:34`) although the §V VLM already reads invoices.
>
> **Scope guard (anti-over-engineering — a standing rule for this section).** A task is admitted only
> if it (a) fixes something that is false or broken today, (b) reuses what already exists (Redis queue,
> Postgres, the loaded VLM, the eval-gate rule), or (c) is a differentiator nobody ships. One
> dependency that replaces several beats wiring four. **Deferred until a real user asks:** guardrails,
> connectors (folder/S3 sync at most), Helm, OIDC, GraphRAG/RAPTOR, ColPali, Grafana dashboards. **Not built:** human-review queue UI, bounding-box editor,
> 50 connectors, a second vector store, multi-tenant SaaS.
>
> **Read budget.** Pick a block with `grep -n '^### E' TODO.md`; read that block and the files its
> **Files** line names — nothing else (see "How to pick up a task").
>
> **Labels** `[BE]` `[FE]` `[DOCS]` `[TEST]` `[INFRA]`. **Dependency order, tiers and gate classes** live
> in the board below and in each block's own **Depends.** / **Agent.** lines — the prose version was
> removed 2026-10-08 because a block-only reader never saw it.
>
> **Migration filenames in blocks are nominal** (`0010_chunks` …): take the next free revision at
> implementation time, keep the slug, report the real number in **Handoff.**

#### §E board — scheduling view for the lead agent (one row per open block; workers flip only their own row)

Status values: `open` · `in progress (agent)` · `ready-for-live (branch)` · `done YYYY-MM-DD`. A row may start
when every block in *Depends on* is `done`; rows sharing a *Serialize with* entry never run concurrently; gate
classes are defined in [`.claude/context/gates.md`](.claude/context/gates.md) ("Gate classes"). Procedure:
`.claude/skills/orchestrate/SKILL.md`. The lead refreshes the Status snapshot once per wave; workers never do.

### E1. P0 — corrections that change the publishable evidence (weeks 1–2)

E1.1–E1.9 shipped 2026-09-17 → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). E1.14 closed 2026-10-08, E1.10 and E1.11 on 2026-10-09 — wave 0 is done.

### E2. Distribution + launch kit (weeks 2–3)

### E3. P1 — real hybrid RAG + scanned documents (weeks 3–7)

### E4. Bring your own adapter — Adapta verifies and serves adapters; it does not train them (weeks 3–9)

> **Decision (2026-10-09).** In-product QLoRA training is removed. It needed a CUDA host, a 7.4 GB worker
> image and a torch/triton/bitsandbytes/peft/trl set whose drift broke every training job on one rebuild
> (E1.9), and its GPU-only gates serialized the roadmap — for a capability whose real use is narrow
> (classification, output format, extraction on small bases; knowledge belongs in RAG). What stays is the
> differentiator: an adapter serves only after it beats the base on the project's own eval set, and it
> composes with RAG on one OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Operators train where they already do (Unsloth,
> Axolotl, TRL, Colab) and import the result.
>
> **Fixed choices.** Accepted: a GGUF LoRA, or a PEFT adapter (`adapter_model.safetensors` +
> `adapter_config.json`) converted on CPU — never pickle (`.bin`, `.pt`). An eval set is mandatory: no eval
> set, no gate, no serving. Text adapters only (vision adapters: §E6). No training code ships in the repo;
> the import guide (E4.7) states what an external run must match.
>
> **One image, all CPU.** After E4.1 the worker runs the `app` image and consumes queued job kinds
> (`adapter` E4.4, `index` E3.7, `extract` E5.4); no service reserves a GPU. Optional llama.cpp GPU offload
> for serving (`ADAPTA_N_GPU_LAYERS`) is unaffected.

### E5. Differentiation (weeks 10–13)

### E6. Deferred — recorded, not promised (open a block only when a user asks)
- Guardrails (LLM Guard) · connectors beyond folder/S3 sync · Helm · OIDC · GraphRAG/RAPTOR · ColPali ·
  Grafana dashboards (G4) · rate limiting on `/v1/chat/completions` (G3) · audit
  log/soft-delete (§7.5) · document-level ACL (needs E3.1: `chunks.principals` + a mandatory filter) ·
  Qwen3 family onboarding (new conversion spike).
- Adapter import, later scope (§E4 shipped text-only): vision (VLM) adapters — conversion with the
  mmproj and image eval sets · multi-turn eval rows · LLM-as-judge for `freeform` eval sets · in-product
  training, only if a paying user cannot train elsewhere.


Carried over when the shipped sections moved to the changelog (2026-10-08):
- Multimodal RAG (CLIP image *retrieval* — distinct from §V image *understanding*) · hosted/multi-tenant SaaS
  edition · heavy MLOps (MLflow, DVC) · additional API protocols (Anthropic/MCP/Responses) · license/packaging
  decision (open-core vs commercial self-hosted).
- Soft-delete + audit log (formerly §7.5): `deleted_at` on projects, an `audit_log` table, admin-only permanent
  delete. Data-safety, not a security boundary; evaluate when multi-admin deployments appear.
- Coverage ratchet (formerly §1.2): the global floor stays at 30 % until a model-bearing CI job runs the opt-in
  suites (`chat.py`, `rag.py`, `embeddings.py` are exercised only by the RAG e2e + slow tests).
- Adapta as an assistant inside Tack: [docs/adr/0001-adapta-as-tack-assistant.md](docs/adr/0001-adapta-as-tack-assistant.md)
  (status: proposed; no block opened).

## Definition of done (per task)

A task is done only when: (1) its contract changed first if it touches API/schema/model; (2) the relevant gate is **green in CI**, not just locally; (3) no `detail=str(e)` reintroduced; (4) generated artifacts regenerated, not hand-edited; (5) docs updated in the same PR.
